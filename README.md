Description: Predict future cryptocurrency prices (such as Bitcoin or Ethereum) using his-torical market data, technical indicators, and machine learning models like LSTM or Random Forests to capture price trends and volatility.
Business Problem:
Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile, making it difficult for investors and traders to make informed decisions. This project aims to provide accurate price predictions to help manage risks, optimize trading strategies, and improve investment outcomes.
Research Questions:
1.	What factors most influence cryptocurrency price fluctuations?
2.	Does incorporating external data, such as news sentiment, enhance forecast reliabil-ity?
Datasets
The data for the cryptocurrency price prediction project will be sourced from publicly avail-able platforms such as: CoinGecko. The dataset will include cryptocurrency time series da-ta (prices, volume, market cap), technical indicators (e.g., RSI, moving averages), and op-tional external data such as social media sentiment, and news analysis.
Methods
The project will use exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, time series models (ARI-MA, LSTM), and machine learning (Random Forest) to predict cryptocurrency prices.
Ethical Considerations 
Ethical concerns in cryptocurrency price prediction include the risk of market manipulation, data privacy issues, and potential bias in models, which could mislead investors. Addition-ally, advanced predictive tools might exacerbate financial inequality by benefiting wealthier traders.
Challenges
Fundamental challenges include handling the high volatility and unpredictability of crypto-currency markets, which can impact model accuracy. Additionally, integrating diverse data sources like social media sentiment and ensuring data quality and timeliness may compli-cate analysis and model training.
References
Sources like CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and Yahoo Finance will be used for comparison with actual historical data, along with academic research and industry reports to benchmark models. Additionally, standard evaluation metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) will help assess the model's performance and accuracy.
